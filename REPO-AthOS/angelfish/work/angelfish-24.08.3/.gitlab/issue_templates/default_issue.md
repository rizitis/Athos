## What kind of issue do you want to open?

* [ ] **Bug**:
  Please mention the distribution and user interface you are running Angelfish on.
* [ ] **Feature request**:
  * [ ] **I want to work on the feature**:
        Feel free to use this issue as tracking issue for your work
  * [ ] **I don't want to work on the feature**:
        If you think you have a cool new idea, please describe it.
        But please try not to open issues for obvious missing features,
        to keep the number of issues down to make it easier to find tracking issues and bug reports.
        If the issue tracker gets to crowded, only the latest issues get attention and important tasks might be overlooked,
        which would defeat the purpose of the issue tracker.
