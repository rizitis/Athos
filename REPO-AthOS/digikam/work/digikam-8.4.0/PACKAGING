Notice to make release tarballs from GIT
----------------------------------------

1/  Release announcements can be send to kde-i18n-docs if internationalized strings are frozen.
    The earlier is better.

2/  Commit last changes from source code to GIT. The code MUST compile in all cases.

3/  Update the release info in top level CMakeLists.txt and commit to GIT.

4/  Update the release info in appdata files for digiKam and Showfoto. Commit to GIT.

5/  Update NEWS file. If ChangeLog is a dry historical record of development,
    NEWS should focus on the improvements and changes, summarize everything since
    last major release. Look in bugzilla for closed file summaries.
    Commit to GIT.

    Note: after a stable release, the NEWS file is moved from the root directory to the project sub-directory
    with the release IDs as file-name suffix. The NEWS file from the root directory is cleaned for the next release.

6/  Tag Git with the release version in this format: vX.Y.Z-suffix.
    Use these commands:

       git tag -a vX.Y.Z-suffix -m "Create version X.Y.Z-suffix"
       git push origin vX.Y.Z-suffix

    Where X is major version, Y minor version, and Z the patch version.
    The optional suffix is to indicate a non final release, as "-beta1" for ex.
    Look with "git tag" command for exiting tags in git.
    These git tags will be used to make tarball and all bundles.

7/  Edit the bootstrap.tarball and patch the value from TARBALL_VERSION.
    Run the bootstrap.tarball script to release digiKam source tarball. This will include all translations
    files and the documentation. The script compiles all translations files to see if nothing is broken.
    At the end, if all is fine, the tarball properties must be displayed.
    3 files are generated:

       Source code tarball compressed as tar.xz.
       The archive signature is done with gpg.
       The SHA-256 checksums of files.

    Note: if .sig files are not generated with GPG, you can process signature computation with the command line
    below. In this example, the GPG key is installed to ~/.gnupg/dkorg-gpg-pwd.txt.

    cat ~/.gnupg/dkorg-gpg-pwd.txt | gpg --batch --yes --passphrase-fd 0 -stabv "tarball_file_to_sign" && mv "tarball_file_to_sign.asc" "tarball_file_to_sign.sig"

    NOTE: project/scripts/signbundles.sh can batch sign all files in current directory.

8/  Upload tarball and signature to temporary FTP server at url

    ftp://upload.kde.org/incoming for the final publication.

    Create a "system admin task" to publish the files officially on download servers from this url:

    https://phabricator.kde.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/2/

    Title: "New digiKam release X.Y.Z tarballs and bundles for Windows, Linux, and MacOS"

    Description:

        Destination: stable/digikam/X.Y.Z/
        ...
        List of SHA-256 + file names
        ...

    Note: for beta release, destination is "unstable/digikam/"

 9/ Create bundles files with signatures for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. See README.BUNDLES for details.
    Use same workflow than source tarball.

10/ Create a release announcement page on digikam.org web site.

    Web-site is hosted in a dedicated release repository: https://invent.kde.org/websites/digikam-org/
    Website repository use a staging branch named "dev" to review changes before to post contents officially.
    See this README file for details: https://invent.kde.org/websites/digikam-org/blob/master/README
    The release announcement can use MarkDown format and are located to "news" directory.

    Don't forget to patch default download links with new stable releases files in data/release.yml.

11/ Perform an official release announcement to these mailing-lists:

    digikam-users@kde.org
    digikam-devel@kde.org
    kde-announce@kde.org
