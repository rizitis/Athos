    upnp: fix exposed directory URLs schemes
    
    Previous implementation generated input item directories with URLs not
    compliant with *RFC 3986* in an attempt to keep the original URL while
    triggering the UPNP directory acces properly. Here's an exemple of a
    previous upnp directory url:
    
    > upnp://http://192.168.1.109:32469/cds?ObjectID=0
    
    The stacking of schemes (`upnp://http://`) is problematic and leads to
    most of the validators failing on those generated URLs (see the
    referenced issue).
    
    This patch fix the issue by simply replacing the original `http://`
    scheme by `upnp://` instead of stacking both. To avoid any potential
    regression with some obscure usage forcing https, a shortcut of the
    directory access is introduced for https specificaly.
    
    The example above would then be fixed like that:
    
    > upnp://192.168.1.109:32469/cds?ObjectID=0
    
    Potential use-cases with https would instead generate the following:
    
    > upnps://192.168.1.109:32469/cds?ObjectID=0

    Object ID is not supposed to be URI-encoded by default and can be pretty

    to encode it to preserve the URL validity.

    extras/tools: use 'command -v' to assert commands
    
    Currently we are using commandname --version to check wheather a
    command exists. Hence if a command is not shipped with --version the
    check fails. For example busybox implementation of sha512sum fails
    to get detected via this method.
    
    Use command -v to check whether a command exists to fix this limitation.

    tools: bootstrap: remove non-digits from minor version
    
    libtool is notoriously known to have been patched over the time and was
    provided as 2.4.7-dirty on archlinux, which makes the integer comparison
    test fail since 7-dirty is not an integer.

    tools: bootstrap: use shell || instead of test -o
    
    shell || nicely handles the commands on the other lines without escaping
    the end of line, which provides better error message in case of error.
    In addition, priority of operators is much more obvious since the []
    test syntax provides a visible scope-like feeling.

    extras/tools: libtool: fix support for bitcode
    
    When building with bitcode enabled (*FLAGS+=-fembed-bitcode), the
    following happens:
    
     - with LDFLAGS += -fembed-bitcode, the vanilla libtool version will
       remove the -fembed-bitcode flag, being an unknown flag, so bitcode
       won't actually be enabled, and final link steps might complain that
       the dylibs (libvlccore.dylib for instance) doesn't actually have
       bitcode embedded.
    
     - once fixed (either by this patch or by using -Wl,-fembed-bitcode),
       the plugins will be compiled with -module, which default to using
       MH_BUNDLE on iOS/tvOS/MacOSX instead of MH_DYLIB. Indeed, dylibs can
       be dlopened only since MacOSX 10.3/10.4, and can be dlclosed only
       since MacOSX 10.5, so MH_BUNDLE was the primary target for libtool
       module support. However, MH_BUNDLE is not compatible with the bitcode
       support from Clang.
    
    Since we support MacOSX 10.11 as minimum, we can default to using
    MH_DYLIB for plugins to have the bitcode support.
    
    This new libtool patch add the explicit support for -fembed-bitcode in
    libtool --mode=link flags, and change the flags used when using -module
    in libtool to switch to dylibs.

    contrib: asdcplib: Apply a patch to fix compilation with latest Clang
    
    The asdcplib code contains a C++ template which refers to member
    variables that doesn't exist. Earlier, this hasn't been an issue,
    as the C++ template never is instantiated, but current Clang
    versions (the upcoming 19.x version) diagnoses such issues already
    before the class is instantiated, leading to compilation errors
    on the asdcplib code.
    
    This applies https://github.com/cinecert/asdcplib/pull/137 (which
    hasn't yet received any attention), fixing
    https://github.com/cinecert/asdcplib/issues/136.

    http: allow short response byte range
    
    RFC9110 specifies that a client must handle a shorter response range
    than requested in all circumstanges. Previously, RFC7233 only required
    that behaviour for multipart ranges, which VLC did not use.
    
    This matches the newer specification: VLC will try to resume from the
    last received offset not only on unexpected error, but also on short
    response.
    
    Fixes #28627.

    caopengllayer: fix using layer outside of main thread
    
    When stopping the playback, vout_display_t destructor will call the
    [VideoView vlcClose] which references the backing CALayer through [self
    layer]. This function is not thread-safe and should only be called from
    the main thread, leading to reports and crashes when using the main
    thread checker.
    
    Instead, since we allocate the layer and references it from the
    vout_display_t implementation, just send the vlcClose message on the
    stored layer directly. Since it's only used to pass from the vd from the
    view to the layer, and it's initialized from a dispatch_sync() in the
    Open() function, there won't be race de-initializing them in a
    non-synchronized fashion like done in this commit.
    
    Fixes #27513

    contrib: amf: update to 1.4.30 using git
    
    It's faster to get the files from git and compress than downloading
    the 400 MB+ package.
    
    We don't use download_git which downloads the whole git history of the
    given branch. We use git clone and a sparse checkout to only get the
    folder we want for the giant repository.

    configure: add upper version constraint on libplacebo
    
    Libplacebo v6 substantially reworks the public API related to color
    spaces, tone mapping, and more - and also requires GLSL 130 as a minimum
    version, as well as access to OpenGL-backed textures to do any
    nontrivial form of color mapping.
    
    Not only does this result in compilation failures, but it also totally
    prevents basic operation. These problems can be addressed on VLC v4, but
    backporting all of that to VLC v3 would be prohitively costly. As such,
    simply prevent VLC v3 from being combined with libplacebo v6,
    intentionallly or otherwise.
