Status overview of the Calligra manuals
--------------------------------------

General goal for Calligra 2.0: all applications should have up-to-date and
feature-complete manuals.

- The user interfaces should be fully described (toolbars, menus, etc.) and
  the screenshots should match the actual looks and be consistent in style and
  presentation. A consistent way of describing the menu entries would be very
  nice as well.

- Common tasks should be described in a clear way, where needed using a how-to
  or tutorial like approach.

- Technical information should be separated from actual user information.
  Whether we should put developer stuff in a separate handbook or just remove
  it from the manuals completely is an open question for me at this point.

- Especially for the larger applications: we should take a look at other
  manuals and their tables of contents to see what information is included and
  how they present it. A good theft is better than a bad idea, after all...

The list of maintainers should be kept up-to-date at the Calligra "get
involved" documentation page: http://calligra.org/getinvolved/doc-writers.php

Calligra - general

Too technical - basically a complete rewrite is needed. More focus on the
common interface and on the component system, less on the technicalities
(don't mention KPart!). General configuration options may be included, but on
the UI level only. This depends on the 2.0 user interface though. Perhaps even
remove this part and combine the useful information with KOShell?

KOShell (Calligra workspace)

Update for 2.0 interface - this goes for all parts, let's just mention it
here. The "Under the hood" section should be moved to developer documentation,
the rest seems to be fine.

Words

The introduction and the Fundamentals should be restyled.
Most of the appendices, but also some other sections, are pretty much
outdated. (1.3!)

Tables

Not much additional remarks.

Stage

Some stuff is outdated (1.3!). Apart from the Menu/Toolbar items chapter,
there are almost no screenshots and only very little actual text.
It's also questionable if we should include tips on how you should do
presentations. If so, it ought to be an appendix, not a running chapter.

Karbon

Easy: no documentation at all.

KChart

Fairly complete.

KFormula

Fairly complete.
