This text provides a very short introduction to the architecture of
the formula shape. At this time it's work in progress.


Part I: Components

Part I describes the organization of the code and what can be found
where.


Subdirectories
==============

elements/       classes for XML elements in MathML
fonts/          some fonts with mathematical characters
pics/           pictures for the icons
scripts/        a python script that generates the Dictionary class
templates/      MathML templates (currently only one) - seems unused.
tests/          test code (run it by 'make tests')


Classes in the top directory
============================

Shape classes
-------------
KoFormulaShapePlugin    All these classes are standard KoShape classes
KoFormulaShapeFactory
KoFormulaShape
KoFormulaToolFactory
KoFormulaTool
FormulaToolWidget
FormulaToolWidget.ui

FormulaDocument         This class inherits KoDocument. A formula and
                        a chart are special shapes because they are
                        their own document types, defined in ODF. This
                        also means that they can be saved in a
                        subdirectory or inline inside the XML tree.

Formula classes
---------------

The following classes are central in the loading, rendering and
editing of formulas.  

AttributeManager        Manages attributes for elements (mostly
                        styling for rendering) 
Dictionary              Dictionary of MathML elements and entities
ElementFactory          A factory that generates an Element from a tagname
FormulaCursor           Points to a position in the MathML tree
                        Also handles selections.
FormulaData             A QObject wrapper around a FormulaElement (see below)
                        Allows communication with the formula tool
FormulaEditor           A class to perform programmatical manipulations
                        of a formula. The tool goes through this class
                        when editing.
FormulaRenderer         Renders a formula in two steps:
                          1. Calls layout() on each element
                          2. Calls paint() on each element. 
                        Also helps when something is updated through
                        the FormulaEditor.


Classes in elements/
--------------------

These classes store the actual data of the formula. Each class
represents a type of element and has its own layout and rendering
function. 

The base class for them all is the BasicElement. This is the base
class for all elements and defines the API for rendering and
editing. 

The classes forms the following inheritance tree:

BasicElement			Element base class
    RowElement                  A container for other elements aligned in a row.
        ActionElement
        EncloseElement
        ErrorElement
        FencedElement
        FormulaElement
        PaddedElement
        PhantomElement
        SquareRootElement
        StyleElement
        TableDataElement
    AnnotationElement
    FixedElement                A base class for MathML elements with
                                a fixed number of children
        FractionElement
        MultiscriptElement
        RootElement
        SubSupElement
        UnderOverElement
    SpaceElement
    TableElement
    TableRowElement
    TokenElement                A base class for MathML token
                                elements. The inherited classes all
                                hold some form of token (text or string).
        GlyphElement
        IdentifierElement
        NumberElement
        OperatorElement
        StringElement
        TextElement
    UnknownElement              Used when an unknown MathML tag is parsed.


Structurally, a formula tree in the formula shape always has a
FormulaElement as the top node. This node has a size which is the
union of all the child element's sizes.


Part II: Functional description

Part II contains high-level descriptions on key processes such as
rendering and editing.


Rendering
=========

Rendering is done in the following steps (see more details below):

 1. Call layout() on the top element, which in turn calls layout() 
    recursively on all its children. This establishes the minimum size
    of the formula tree.
 2. Call stretch() on the top element, which in turn calls stretch()
    recursively on all its children.  This establishes the maximum size
    of the formula tree.
 3. Given the layout created in step 1 and 2, call paint() on the top
    element, which calls paint() recursively on its children and
    then paints itself.


Editing
=======

This chapter describes the editing process and how the data structures
are manipulated.

Cursor position
---------------

Before we can describe the editing process, we have to define what a
_position_ in a formula is. There are two ways a position can be
interpreted:

The formula shape uses a tree of objects which all ultimately inherit
the BasicElement class. All elements except those inheriting the
TokenElement class can hold one or more children. All elements which
have child elements are either using implicit row elements or actually
inheriting the RowElement. A token element is one of identifier (tag:
mi), number (tag: mn) or operator (tag: mo).

A position is an integer number that goes from 0 to n where n is the
number of children (most elements) or number of characters (token
elements). Position #0 is before the first child/character, #1 is
after the first child/character, and #n is after the last child
element / character.

The _cursor position_ is a combination of an object, the so-called
"Current Element" and a numeric position inside that object.  We will
denote this [<object>,position] here.

Consider the formula 'sqrt(a+b)' which in MathML is expressed:
  <mroot>
    <mrow>
      <mi>a</mi>
      <mo>+</mo>
      <mi>b</mi>
    </mrow>
  </mroot>

The cursor can have the following positions (marked with '*' and
'¤'). Possible positions inside a token element are shown as '¤' and
possible positions inside an (inferred) row element are shown as '*'.

  *sqrt(*¤a¤*¤+¤*¤b¤*)*

Since the formula is always embedded into an implicit FormulaElemnt,
the representation of this tree inside the formula shape is (with the
same positions as above marked):

<formula>*
  <mroot>
    <mrow>*
      <mi>¤a¤</mi>*
      <mo>¤+¤</mo>*
      <mi>¤b¤</mi>*
    </mrow>
  </mroot>*
</formula>

So the cursor position for the first and last asterisk is [<formula>,0] and 
[<formula>,1] respectively. The cursor positions inside the root are
[<mrow>,0], ..., [<mrow>,3]. The <mrow> element is implicit inside
the <mroot> element and not visible from the outside. 


Selection
---------

The class that keeps track of a cursor position is the FormulaCursor.
The same class also keeps track of the current selection. The
selection is defined as the objects between two different cursor
positions inside the same object. One end of the selection is the
current cursor position. The other end is the so called _mark_, which
is represented by an integer position in the same object as the
cursor. This means that the selection can only span subobjects inside
the same parent.


Editing
-------

The root object of the formula tree inside the formula shape is a
FormulaElement.  This FormulaElement is embedded into a FormulaData
object which is a QObject. The purpose of the FormulaData object is to
connect the formula tree with the outside world in the form of the
shape and the formula tool.

The formula shape inherits the standard KoShape base class and the
formula tool inherits KoToolBase. This means that all events (mouse,
keyboard, etc) are channeled into the FormulaTool which interprets the
events and uses a FormulaEditor object to perform the actual
changes. The formula tool also opens an option widget in the
docker. This widget is created by the FormulaToolWidget class and
communicates with the formula tool using signals and slots.

The rest to be written.
