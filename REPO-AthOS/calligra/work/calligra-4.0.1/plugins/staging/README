This is the staging directory.  The shapes in this directory are not
released as part of the public Calligra releases and can be developed
on their own pace.

This should be the starting point for all new shapes that aspire to
become part of the Calligra source code.  When the shape is working
well, put a review up at reviewboard.kde.org and after the review is
passed it can be moved to the parent directory. After this, the shape
is officially part of the Calligra suite.
