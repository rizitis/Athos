This plugin will allow users to use other kde connect devices as external displays.

It will use krfb-virtualmonitor to create it and feed the information and also request an URL to be opened on the other device that should be rendering the contents.

Upon connection, we'll be notifying under kdeconnect.virtualmonitor about our "resolutions, which include objects with a "resolution" and a "scale". These will provide the information necessary to issue a remote feed.

When a virtual monitor is requested, kdeconnect.virtualmonitor.request will include a "url" field that contains all information necessary to connect to the created feed. The remote client needs to support this url type.
