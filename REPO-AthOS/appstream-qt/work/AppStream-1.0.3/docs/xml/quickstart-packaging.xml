		<para>
			A binary package that contains AppStream desktop metadata  (<xref linkend="sect-Metadata-Application"/>)
			must also contain both the .desktop file for the application and the application itself.
		</para>
		<para>
			A binary package must not contain more than one AppStream metadata file. The one exception is
			that it is permissable for a binary package that is extended by addons to include those addons
			(<xref linkend="sect-Metadata-Addon"/>) and their AppStream metadata files. Note that users
			will be unable to remove those addons separately.
		</para>
		<para>
			Except for the extended package, no other package may contain more than one Appstream addon metadata file.
