To ensure that your nftables rules are applied at boot, follow these steps:

1. Edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file:
   sudo nano /etc/rc.d/rc.local

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:
   if [ -x /usr/sbin/nft ]; then
       /usr/sbin/nft -f /etc/nftables.conf
   fi

3. Make the rc.local file executable:
   sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local

This will ensure that your custom nftables rules are automatically applied
every time your system starts, but only if nftables is available.
