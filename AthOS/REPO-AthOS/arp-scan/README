arp-scan

arp-scan sends ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) queries to the 
specified targets, and displays any responses that are received.
It allows any part of the outgoing ARP packets to be changed, 
allowing the behavior of targets to non-standard ARP packets to be 
examined. The IP address and hardware address of received packets are
displayed, together with the vendor details.
