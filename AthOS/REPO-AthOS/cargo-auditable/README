cargo-auditable Make production Rust binaries auditable
cargo-auditable Cargo wrapper for embedding auditing data. Know the exact crate versions used to build your Rust executable. Audit binaries for known bugs or security vulnerabilities in production, at scale, with zero bookkeeping. This works by embedding data about the dependency tree in JSON format into a dedicated linker section of the compiled executable.
