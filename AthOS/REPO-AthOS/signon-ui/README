 Scipt install in "$PKG"/usr/share/accounts/providers/kde/ a google.provider.NEW file.
 You will need this if google not allow signon-ui to login because it not like it...
 This way you can login as it looks like Google is in love with Gnome :D

After installation finish if needed cmd as root:

# mv /usr/share/accounts/providers/kde/google.provider /usr/share/accounts/providers/kde/google.provider.orig
# mv /usr/share/accounts/providers/kde/google.provider.NEW /usr/share/accounts/providers/kde/google.provider
