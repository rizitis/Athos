Unless your existing installation script already contains the code
to create these links, you should append these lines to your existing
install script. Now's your chance. :^)

Would you like to add this stuff to the existing install script and
remove the symbolic links ([y]es, [n]o)? y


Removing symbolic links:
removed './usr/lib64/libKF5PeopleBackend.so'
removed './usr/lib64/libKF5People.so.5'
removed './usr/lib64/libKF5People.so'
removed './usr/lib64/libKF5PeopleWidgets.so.5'
removed './usr/lib64/libKF5PeopleWidgets.so'
removed './usr/lib64/libKF5PeopleBackend.so.5'

Updating your ./install/doinst.sh...

This next step is optional - you can set the directories in your package
to some sane permissions. If any of the directories in your package have
special permissions, then DO NOT reset them here!

Would you like to reset all directory permissions to 755 (drwxr-xr-x) and
directory ownerships to root:root ([y]es, [n]o)? n
