kgeotag Photo geotagging program
kgeotag A standalone geotagging program. Images can be associated with geographic coordinates by different means: On the one hand, a matching with GPX encoded geodata can be done, on the other hand, the coordinates can be set manually, either via drag and drop onto a map, via bookmarks or by manually supplying them. The coordinates can be stored in the images' Exif header and/or in XMP sidecar files.
