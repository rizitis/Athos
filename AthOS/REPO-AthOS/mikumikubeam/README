List of proxies.txt are example free proxies please test if work and then replace them with yours.
All files stored in /usr/share/mikumikubeam/proxies.txt
Same way you can also replace uas.txt

To start CMD: mikumikubeam
it will start server which run on port 3000 by default.
The frontend (usually accessible at http://localhost:5173), where you can configure and visualize your attacks.
so the same time xdg-open will load your default network browser to http://localhost:5173
If you dont like this you can edit /usr/local/bin/mikumikubeam or even delete it!
To run server from terminal: cd /usr/share/mikumikubeam && npm run dev
then open browser in http://localhost:5173

Note: server is missing for now npm stop from its dev, so it stopt only by Ctl+c
in case you messed up:
lsof -i :3000
and kill -9 PIDs
