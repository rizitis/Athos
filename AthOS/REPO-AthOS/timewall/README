After installation finish if you intend to use sun position based wallpapers, you need to provide timewall with your approximate location.
as user create:

mkdir -p ~/.config/timewall/
touch ~/.config/timewall/config.toml

And in toml file add your locations:

[location]
lat = 35.51 # replace it with yours
lon = 24.01 # replace it with yours

then repeat the same as root:
mkdir -p ~/.config/timewall/
touch ~/.config/timewall/config.toml

And in toml file add your locations:

[location]
lat = 35.51 # replace it with yours
lon = 24.01 # replace it with yours

To set the wallpaper just run as user:
timewall set /path/to/wallpaper.heif

---

To download heif wallpapers:

---

To preview the wallpaper, run:

timewall preview path/to/wallpaper.heif

---

To have timewall running on startup:
cp /usr/doc/$PRGNAM-$VERSION/run_timewall.desktop ~/.config/autostart/run_timewall.desktop
You can modify as for your needs...

If you have a folder with varius *.heic images and you want to have random wallpapers you can run a cyclic_wallpapers script.
One example might be something like this:
