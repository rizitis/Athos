1) Before build/install as root:
# sh gerbera-preinstall.sh

2) After build and install as root:
# sh gerbera-postinstall.sh

3) YOU MUST open in any case /etc/gerbera/config.xml
and be sure (edit if needed) that:
<home>/etc/gerbera</home>

4) Also I think its good idea to:
cd /etc/gerbera && ls -s /var/lib/gerbera/* .


5) To start-stop:
/etc/rc.d/rc.gerbera {start,stop}

6) After server start, open web-browser:
/etc/gerbera/gerbera.html
