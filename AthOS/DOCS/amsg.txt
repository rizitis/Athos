# Passing multiple arguments, each will be treated as a separate line
amsg "Line 1" "Line 2" "Line 3"

# Multiline ASCII message passed as a single argument with actual line breaks
amsg "This is the first line
This is the second line
This is the third line"

# If you pass multiple lines and add "--no-newline" at the start
amsg "--no-newline This is the first line
This is the second line
This is the third line"

# Redirection to a file (multiple lines)
amsg "Line 1" "Line 2" >> my_log.txt
amsg "Line 3" >> my_log.txt

Output:

    Multiple arguments: Each argument will be printed on a new line.
    Multiline strings: The line breaks (\n) in the input will be preserved and printed on separate lines.
    No Newline: If you use --no-newline, the message will print without a trailing newline.

Key Features:

    Supports ASCII multiline: Whether you are passing multiline strings or multiple arguments, the line breaks will be respected and rendered correctly.
    Redirection: You can still use redirection (>, >>) to save the output into files or pass it along through pipes.
